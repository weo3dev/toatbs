### Tired of all the BS

# Habits and Their Impact on Our Developer Life
We all have habits. Some are beneficial to our health, like exercise and learning new things. Some have negative impact on our health, like smoking anything, or doing any one thing in excess.


For too long we have relied on a way of thinking about and building websites that has existed out of necessity. However, for two years near, the necessity no longer exists. Yet we still think of layout and building websites the same way. I believe we do this now out of habit and "comfort in the familiar", rather than with how we could be doing things, which in fact would be easier, better, and more beneficial to our developer health.


This is an effort to change that.
